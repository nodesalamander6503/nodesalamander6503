				This web site is being remodeled to use a more modern CMS and SSG.
			</p>
			<p>
				The new CMS will allow a greater variety of content to be hosted on this site.
				For instance, it'll allow for <em>interactive demos</em>.
				These new features are intended to permit better demonstration of information.
				Expected site features include minigames, live or semi-live statistical predictions, simulations and emulations, neural networks that run in-browser, and more.
			</p>
			<p>
				The new SSG is therefore necessary to support this.
				It will be able to generate new types of HTML5 and ECMAScript, permitting both <em>static and dynamic widgets</em> for various roles and capabilities.
				The new SSG will also support modern accessibility endeavors.
				It'll permit people using screenreaders and other automated or semiautomated interfaces to interact more easily with my web site.
				This will be accomplished by using HTML5 semantic components, as well as by using the ARIA accessibility metadata tags.
				It'll even be able to handle multilingual text.
				This will vastly increase the accessibility and usability of the site.
			</p>
			<p>
				In summary, the web site is being remodeled to use a more modern CMS and SSG.
				The result of these new features will be to create a novel, more interesting experience for those who come to the site, while also increasing the amount of people who are capable of using this site.

			In this article, I&#x27;ll discuss how I extended my renderer to support triangles and simple color banding.
			This is the second article in my nodeTeapot series, where I continue exploring different approaches to 3D rendering.
			After rendering the Utah Teapot as a collection of points, the natural next step was to render it properly using triangles.

			In this article, I&#x27;ll discuss how I extended my renderer to support triangles and simple color banding.

<h2>
<span id = "-Goal-" class = "hook"> </span>
 Goal 
</h2>
<p>
<span id = "
			The-goal-of-this" class = "hook"> </span>

			The goal of this version was twofold:
			First, to transition from rendering individual points to rendering filled triangles.
			Second, to experiment with simple color banding techniques to give the render a stylized appearance by discretizing colors in the style of old 8bit images.
		
</p>
<h2>
<span id = "-Implementation-" class = "hook"> </span>
 Implementation 
</h2>
<p>
<span id = "
			I-started-by-imp" class = "hook"> </span>

			I started by implementing basic triangle rasterization.
			For each triangle, I computed its screen-space coordinates after projection, and filled it using a simple scanline algorithm.
			To handle depth properly, I used a z-buffer to ensure that nearer triangles obscure farther ones.
		
</p>
<p>
<span id = "
			For-color-bandin" class = "hook"> </span>

			For color banding, I quantized the shading into a small number of discrete levels based on depth or the triangle&#x27;s normal.
			This gives the result a somewhat artificial, posterized look — something between &quot;retro 3D graphics&quot; and &quot;procedural art experiment.&quot;
			The brass color from the first version became optional; now I could experiment with any color palette I liked.
		
</p>
<p>
<span id = "
			To-demonstrate-t" class = "hook"> </span>

			To demonstrate the improvements, I again rendered the Utah Teapot.
			However, I decided not to keep the other elements with it.
			This time, the teapot now appeared to be a solid object, not just collections of floating points.
			It almost looks like a normal 3D render.
		
</p>
<h2>
<span id = "-Thoughts-" class = "hook"> </span>
 Thoughts 
</h2>
<p>
<span id = "
			This-version-of-" class = "hook"> </span>

			This version of the renderer felt like a natural evolution from the point-cloud approach.
			It reinforced my understanding of projection, depth handling, and basic rasterization techniques.
			Additionally, experimenting with color banding gave me ideas for future procedural rendering styles.
		
</p>
<p>
<span id = "
			Next,-I-plan-to-" class = "hook"> </span>

			Next, I plan to implement proper camera controls and object transformations.
			This will allow me to move objects independently and explore dynamic scenes, rather than relying on a static center-of-rotation.
