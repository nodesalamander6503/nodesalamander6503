				This web site is being remodeled to use a more modern CMS and SSG.
			</p>
			<p>
				The new CMS will allow a greater variety of content to be hosted on this site.
				For instance, it'll allow for interactive demos.
				These new features are intended to permit better demonstration of information.
				Expected site features include minigames, live or semi-live statistical predictions, simulations and emulations, neural networks that run in-browser, and more.
			</p>
			<p>
				The new SSG is therefore necessary to support this.
				It will be able to generate new types of HTML5 and ECMAScript, permitting both static and dynamic widgets for various roles and capabilities.
				The new SSG will also support modern accessibility endeavors.
				It'll permit people using screenreaders and other automated or semiautomated interfaces to interact more easily with my web site.
				This will be accomplished by using HTML5 semantic components, as well as by using the ARIA accessibility metadata tags.
				It'll even be able to handle multilingual text.
				This will vastly increase the accessibility and usability of the site.
			</p>
			<p>
				In summary, the web site is being remodeled to use a more modern CMS and SSG.
				The result of these new features will be to create a novel, more interesting experience for those who come to the site, while also increasing the amount of people who are capable of using this site.

To assess this market, I used a linear regression model.
I regressed the price value against the UNIX timestamp (in seconds).
I estimated beta-zero to be about -23.9563 and beta-one to be roughly 0.0 dollars/second.
My r-value is 0.9329, which implies high direct correlation.
The p-value is 0.0.

 Potato chips are a very popular snack food, and they are quite representative of the snack industry. Atop being generally regarded as a normal good, they&#x27;re also quite affordable and can be made relatively easily. They also are dependent on many key markets such as sugar, salt, potatoes, and labor. This makes them very effective at reflecting the nature of the snack food market.
