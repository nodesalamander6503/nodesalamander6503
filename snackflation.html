To assess this market, I used a linear regression model.
I regressed the price value against the UNIX timestamp (in seconds).
I estimated beta-zero to be about -23.9563 and beta-one to be roughly 0.0 dollars/second.
My r-value is 0.9329, which implies high direct correlation.
The p-value is 0.0.

 Potato chips

 Potato chips are a very popular snack food, and they are quite representative of the snack industry. Atop being generally regarded as a normal good, they&#x27;re also quite affordable and can be made relatively easily. They also are dependent on many key markets such as sugar, salt, potatoes, and labor. This makes them very effective at reflecting the nature of the snack food market.
