			This is a simple 
<em>demo</em>
 page generated by our static-site generator.
			You should not be able to find this page.
			It should not be linked to anywhere in this site.
			If you are viewing it, congrats!
			You&#x27;ve found a secret.

<h3>
 Sub-heading 
</h3>
<p>

			The generator supports inline 
<em>emphasis</em>
 nodes.
			This is useful form drawing the reader&#x27;s attention to something important.
			For instance, if I wanted to tell everyone that I wrote something 
<em> really cool </em>
 in C, I might put emphasis on that claim.
			Of course, emphasis should not be used in excess.
		
</p>
<p>

			You can also add inline citations 
<a href=" https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/citation " class="citation">[link]</a>
 to your text.
			This lets you back up your claims using sources.
				It is possible to misuse citations; this is quite prevalent in much scientific research 
<a href=" https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8712974/ " class="citation">[link]</a>

			Still, citations are a useful tool and should be employed wherever reasonable.
		
</p>
<p>

			You can also prank 
<a href=" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ " class="citation">[link]</a>
 people using citations, if you are so inclined.
		
</p>
<h3>
 I quoted myself 
</h3>
<p>

			Some quotes are placed inline.
			For instance, I might write &quot;The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting&quot;, which is a well-known Sun Tzu quote.
			Alternatively, I could use a blockquote, like the item which follows:
		
</p>
<blockquote>

			Was it possible to lose the nation, and yet preserve the Constitution? By general law life and limb must be protected; yet often a limb must be amputated to save a life; but a life is never wisely given to save a limb. I felt that measures, otherwise unconstitutional, might become lawful, by becoming indispensable to the preservation of the Constitution, through the preservation of the nation. Right or wrong, I assumed this ground, and now avow it.
		
</blockquote>
<p>

			That&#x27;s an Abraham Lincoln quote.
			Lincoln wrote that (and some other words, too) to a person called Albert G. Hodges in 1864 
<a href=" https://teachingamericanhistory.org/document/letter-to-albert-hodges/ " class="citation">[link]</a>
 in order to exprses his thoughts regarding the Emancipation Proclamation and the surrounding context.
			I think it&#x27;s a pretty neat quote.
