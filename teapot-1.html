				This web site is being remodeled to use a more modern CMS and SSG.
			</p>
			<p>
				The new CMS will allow a greater variety of content to be hosted on this site.
				For instance, it'll allow for <em>interactive demos</em>.
				These new features are intended to permit better demonstration of information.
				Expected site features include minigames, live or semi-live statistical predictions, simulations and emulations, neural networks that run in-browser, and more.
			</p>
			<p>
				The new SSG is therefore necessary to support this.
				It will be able to generate new types of HTML5 and ECMAScript, permitting both <em>static and dynamic widgets</em> for various roles and capabilities.
				The new SSG will also support modern accessibility endeavors.
				It'll permit people using screenreaders and other automated or semiautomated interfaces to interact more easily with my web site.
				This will be accomplished by using HTML5 semantic components, as well as by using the ARIA accessibility metadata tags.
				It'll even be able to handle multilingual text.
				This will vastly increase the accessibility and usability of the site.
			</p>
			<p>
				In summary, the web site is being remodeled to use a more modern CMS and SSG.
				The result of these new features will be to create a novel, more interesting experience for those who come to the site, while also increasing the amount of people who are capable of using this site.

</h2>
<p>
<span id = "
			When-I-set-out-t" class = "hook"> </span>

			When I set out to build my first teapot 3D renderer, my goal was simply to produce a rendering of the Utah Teapot using my own code.
			I wasn’t aiming for a polished image; rather, I wanted to understand how rendering algorithms work by implementing one myself.
		
</p>
<h2>
<span id = "-Implementation-" class = "hook"> </span>
 Implementation 
</h2>
<p>
<span id = "
			There-are-many-m" class = "hook"> </span>

			There are many methods one can use to generate a 3D image.
			Most rely on linear algebra.
			For instance, by multiplying a point by a matrix, I could rotate it in space about some origin.
			Using another matrix, I could project a 3D image into a 2D plane.
			To simulate visual depth, I could warp points that are farther away, bringing them closer to the center of the image.
		
</p>
<p>
<span id = "
			I-decided-to-att" class = "hook"> </span>

			I decided to attempt rendering a 3D entity by drawing a set of points in space, rotating them using matrices, and then projecting them into 2D using a projection matrix and depth function.
		
</p>
<p>
<span id = "
			I-implemented-th" class = "hook"> </span>

			I implemented the functions for rotating points and projecting them from 3D space into 2D.
			To make the points appear more dimensional, I shaded each as a circle with the top slightly brighter and the bottom slightly dimmer.
			Since points exist in 3D space, I needed to sort them before rendering. I used JavaScript’s native sorting algorithm to sort them by depth.
			I chose to render each point in a brass color because it looks visually pleasing.
			To contrast it, I set the background to a dim gray.
		
</p>
<p>
<span id = "
			Finally,-to-test" class = "hook"> </span>

			Finally, to test the renderer, I created a simple &quot;always rotate&quot; script and loaded several objects.
			The Utah teapot, of course, was among them.
			I also included the Utah teaspoon, which is less famous but still interesting.
			Additionally, the renderer displays a sphere and a cube.
		
</p>
<h2>
<span id = "-Thoughts-" class = "hook"> </span>
 Thoughts 
</h2>
<p>
<span id = "
			All-in-all,-this" class = "hook"> </span>

			All in all, this was a fun project and I&#x27;m glad I undertook it.
			This simple renderer helped me better understand the applications of linear algebra to practical 3D modeling.
			It also gave me insight into why the Utah Teapot remains so popular.
		
</p>
<p>
<span id = "
			Of-course,-rende" class = "hook"> </span>

			Of course, rendering only points isn&#x27;t especially exciting.
			For my next project, I’ve decided to render the teapot using triangles instead.
