<div class="card"> <h3>  About Fakespeare  </h3> <p> 
			When I was much younger, I used to   love   reading works of fiction.
			I read Jules Verne and H.G. Wells and Judy Blume and whatever else was located on the shelves near me.
			Unsurprisingly, I also tried my hand at writing books.
			It turns out that it&#x27;s much harder to write a book than to read a book.
			As a result, my book-writing dreams never really got anywhere.

<div class="card"> <h3>  How to cheat at Wordle  </h3> <p> Wordle is a simple game with a lot of underlying complexity.
			In this article, I discuss how I used information theory and probability theory to create a tool to play Wordle as efficiently as possible. </p> <a target="_blank" class="button funky-bg" href="how-to-cheat-at-wordle.html"> Read it! </a> </div>
<div class="card"> <h3>  About Snackflation  </h3> <p> 
			I built a fully automatic tool    to predict market behavior and price indices of popular snack foods.
			It works by using a simple linear regression model to predict the future value of snacks such as potato chips.
			I regressed prices against the date and found that the date tends to have a statistically-significant impact upon price.
			This reflects well-known notions of inflation as predicted by many empirical models, which state that (during short runs) a market tends to be in an inflationary state rather than a deflationary state and all goods&#x27; prices will therefore rise over time, often at rates which are somewhat consistent.
