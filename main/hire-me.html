<h2 id="Introduction"> Introduction </h2><p>
			I'm an enthusiastic polymath and an aspiring econometrist with a diverse set of skills and interests.
			I am currently pursuing a double major at UC San Diego, including a <b>B.S. in Probability and Statistics</b> and a <b>B.A. in Economics</b>.
			I am passionate about using statistics and automata to drive progress and benefit others, and I also endeavor to improve tech accessibility whenever possible.

				<b>Increased financial workflow efficiency by up to 70%</b> by creating scripts to automate and streamline budgeting, accounting, and the procurement and analysis of useful statistics. Supported events team in funding small events.
			</li><li>
				<b>Handled transactions worth thousands of dollars</b> using custom budgeting software to help process and record data, as well as by using people skills to identify bottlenecks and resolve supply issues.
			</li><li> <b>Streamlined 501(c)(3) application process</b> by using tools and automata to ensure legal compliance with 501(c)(3) laws, such as those requiring financial reporting or those restricting certain actions. </li></ul><h3 id="Data-processing-intern-0624-present"> Data processing intern (06/24 - present) </h3><!-- unknown item annotation --><ul><li>
				<b>Made information more accessible to hundreds of users</b> by using Python 3.12 and Google Apps Script / Javascript to create an interactive information directory for a bilingual programs directory.
			</li><li>
				<b>Communicated new information to thousands of users</b> by creating a comprehensive data dashboard for state assessment metrics within the MEGA department, empowering stakeholders to make informed, data-driven decisions. This project used Python 3.12, Google Apps Script / Javascript, and Looker Studio, permitting me to apply both statistical analysis (regression, pattern detection) and soft skills (accessible wording, readable graphics).
			</li></ul><h3 id="Community-Service-Intern-0819-0320"> Community Service Intern (08/19 - 03/20) </h3><!-- unknown item annotation --><ul><li>
				<b>Made online services more accessible to ~28% of users</b> by using Python 3.9 and Javascript / ECMAscript to design and implement a data-driven bilingual web site, replacing an older outdated monolingual web site which had inaccurate data.
			</li></ul><h2 id="Projects-Personal-Experience"> Projects & Personal Experience </h2><h3 id="Economic-Market-Prediction"> Economic Market Prediction </h3><ul><li>
				<b>Predicted food market behaviors</b> by using Python 3.12 and datasets from FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data) to analyze inflation rate of various types of edible goods.
			</li></ul><h3 id="Game-Analysis-using-Information-Theory"> Game Analysis using Information Theory </h3><ul><li>
				<b>Decreased time-to-win by up to 20%</b> by analyzing a game and creating an algorithm to deterministically play the game in the most optimal way. This method employed game theory to analyze the potential results of multiple possible sub-games to discern which has the best predicted score based on estimates of the behavior of future sub-games.
			</li><li>
				<b>Predicted move likeliest to win now</b> by using statistical analysis to discern the probability of any given move to win the game. This permitted me to employ strategies such as Zipf’s Law and simple linear regression.
			</li><li>
				<b>Calculated best long-term strategic moves</b> by using information theory to analyze thousands of possible moves to discern which one would offer the most utility in the long run, by calculating how many Shannons of information that move would yield. This taught me how to optimize for future wins given limited moves.
