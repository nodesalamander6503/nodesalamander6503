<h2 id="Introduction"> <p>  Introduction </p></h2><p>  I'm a polymath who uses mathematical models to observe, analyze, and predict uncertain behaviors in order to make data-driven decisions and achieve practical goals. </p><p>  I study <b> Probability & Statistics </b> as well as <b> Economics </b> at UC San Diego.
			My education and experience has focused on applying statistical modeling, game-theoretic optimization, information theory, and AI to achieve useful effects in a variety of fields.
			My academic work and personal projects emphasize time-series behavior, probabilistic inference, optimization under constraints, and the extraction of interpretable structure from noisy data.
			I work across both the mathematical and computational layers of these problems; I design models, validate them with rigorous statistical tests, and implement them efficiently in code. </p><p>  I am seeking quantitative research or data-driven finance internships where I can apply methods from applied probability, econometrics, and machine learning to real data.
			My goal is to contribute to forecasting, risk analysis, anomaly detection, and the development of systematic strategies that rely on sound mathematical reasoning and careful empirical validation. </p><h2 id="Education"> <p>  Education </p></h2><p>  University of California, San Diego (2022-present): BS in Probability and Statistics, and BA in Economics </p><h2 id="Work-Experience"> <p>  Work Experience </p></h2><h3 id="Head-of-Finance-1024-present"> <p>  Head of Finance (10/24 - present) </p></h3><span class="peculiar"> [Unknown peculiar content] </span><ul>

<li> <p>   <b> Decreased time-to-win by up to 20% </b> by analyzing a game and creating an algorithm to deterministically play the game in the most optimal way. This method employed game theory to analyze the potential results of multiple possible sub-games to discern which has the best predicted score based on estimates of the behavior of future sub-games. </p> </li>
<li> <p>   <b> Predicted move likeliest to win now </b> by using statistical analysis to discern the probability of any given move to win the game. This permitted me to employ strategies such as Zipf’s Law and simple linear regression. </p> </li>
<li> <p>   <b> Calculated best long-term strategic moves </b> by using information theory to analyze thousands of possible moves to discern which one would offer the most utility in the long run, by calculating how many Shannons of information that move would yield. This taught me how to optimize for future wins given limited moves. </p> </li>
