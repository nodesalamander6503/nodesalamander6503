<h2 id="What-is-nodes-sheet-tool"> <p>  What is node's sheet tool? </p></h2><p>  This tool is intended to make your life easier by making budgeting and accounting more straightforward.
			It completely automates the process of tabulating and perusing a ledger of transactions, and is also capable of generating high-quality reports on the state of your accounts. </p><p>  This tool is capable of single-book accounting, ledger management, and report generation.
			As a result, it is intended for the following target audiences: </p><ul> <li> <p>  Individuals and families </p> </li><li> <p>  Family businesses </p> </li><li> <p>  Local artisans </p> </li><li> <p>  Small organizations and clubs </p> </li><li> <p>  Project teams </p> </li> </ul><p>  If you are any of these, then you might find node's sheet tool rather helpful. </p><h2 id="How-to-tabulate-a-ledger"> <p>  How to tabulate a ledger </p></h2><p>  Any single-book ledger that has an "Account" column and a "Value" column can be tabulated.
			Tabulation will tell you exactly what there is in each of your accounts at any given point in time. </p><p>  To tabulate, first go to the tool menu.
			Then press "Tabulate".
			The tabulator will tabulate your ledger and generate a report.
			You can view the report in the pop-up, or press the "Export" button to generate a Google Doc version.
			The Google Doc can then be saved for posterity, or shared with others as a PDF or in an email. </p><h2 id="Data-Formatting"> <p>  Data Formatting </p></h2><p>  In brief, any sheet can be handled by node's data tool so long as it meets the following requirements: </p><ul> <li> <p>   <b> Named columns: </b> All columns must have corresponding names in the first frozen row. </p> </li><li> <p>   <b> Typed columns: </b> The second and final frozen row of any column must either specify the mathematical type corresponding to the data in the column, or be empty.
				This permits the data tool to ensure the quality of your data. </p> </li><li> <p>   <b> Valid data: </b> Any sheet must have reliable, high-quality data.
				Erroneous data will cause the tool to produce false or misleading results. </p> </li> </ul><p>  To gaurantee data quality, node's data tool relies on typed semantic columns.
			This means that the column's name is what decides what the column means, not the column's number.
			For instance, in a ledger, the column that corresponds to the monetary value of a transaction is always the column labelled "Value".
			You can shuffle and rearrange the columns as you desire without impacting the tool's capabilities. </p><p>  When a type mismatch is encountered, such as a date stored in a column intended for numbers, the tool will alert you immediately about the issue.
			It'll do so by highlighting the offending cell in red and giving you a pop-up error notification.
			This ensures that you won't put data in the wrong parts of a table.
			You can therefore use the typechecker to your advantage by having it detect data that are out of place. </p><p>  The following are all the types that the typechecker recognizes: </p><ul> <li> <p>  The <span style="color:red;"> code </span> text type, which corresponds to arbitrary text. </p> </li><li> <p>  The <span style="color:red;"> code </span> any type, which may contain literally anything.
				Note that an empty type entry is assumed to refer to the <span style="color:red;"> code </span> any type. </p> </li><li> <p>  The <span style="color:red;"> code </span> num type, which allows only numbers.
				Positive numbers, negative numbers, and decimals are permissible here.
				However, fractions and scientific notation are currently not supported. </p> </li> </ul><h2 id="Examples"> <p>  Examples </p></h2><p>  The tool comes with several example sheets built into it. </p><p>  To deploy an example, first navigate to the tool's menu.
			Press the menu, then press the option that says "Examples".
			You can then select any example from the list. </p><p>  These examples are fully-functional sheets complete with example data.
			You can use them to try out the tool's features and see what it can do!
			One may also use the examples to jump-start a new ledger or statistical analysis.
			Just find an example that resembles your use-case, then edit it to make it match! </p>
