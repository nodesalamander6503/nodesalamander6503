			I&#x27;m a UC San Diego junior majoring in Probability &amp; Statistics, with a second major in Economics.
			I perform statistical analyses, study market trends, write software, and play games.

 Skills and education 
</h2>
<p>
<span id = "
			I-am-proficient-" class = "hook"> </span>

			I am proficient in several programming languages.
			I am most skilled in modern 
<em> Python </em>
 implementations, especially 3.12.
			Atop data processing tools like Pandas, NumPy, and SciPy, I am also practiced in web scraping.
			I typically engage in web scraping using bs4 and Requests For Humans, but I have used other libraries in the past.

<p>
<span id = "
			I-also-know-R,-S" class = "hook"> </span>

			I also know R, SQL, C, bash, and few other languages.
			I&#x27;ve even managed to implement a few, such as a tiny FORTH-like and a working Brainfuck interpreter.
		
</p>
<p>
<span id = "
			My-favorite-type" class = "hook"> </span>

			My favorite type of statistical regression is the linear regression.
			I love its simplicity and effectiveness.
			However, that&#x27;s not the only method I know.
			I also can use A/B testing, the multi-armed bandit method, random forests, and various types of neural network algorithm.

<div class="card"> <h3>  How to cheat at Wordle  </h3> <p> Wordle is a simple game with a lot of underlying complexity.
			In this article, I discuss how I used information theory and probability theory to create a tool to play Wordle as efficiently as possible. </p> <a target="_blank" class="button funky-bg" href="how-to-cheat-at-wordle.html"> Read it! </a> </div>
<div class="card"> <h3>  About Snackflation  </h3> <p> 
			I built a fully automatic tool    to predict market behavior and price indices of popular snack foods.
			It works by using a simple linear regression model to predict the future value of snacks such as potato chips.
			I regressed prices against the date and found that the date tends to have a statistically-significant impact upon price.
			This reflects well-known notions of inflation as predicted by many empirical models, which state that (during short runs) a market tends to be in an inflationary state rather than a deflationary state and all goods&#x27; prices will therefore rise over time, often at rates which are somewhat consistent.
