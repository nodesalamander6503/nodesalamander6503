<h2>
 Skills and education 
</h2>
<p>

			I am proficient in several programming languages.
			I am most skilled in modern 
<em> Python </em>
 implementations, especially 3.12.
			Atop data processing tools like Pandas, NumPy, and SciPy, I am also practiced in web scraping.
			I typically engage in web scraping using bs4 and Requests For Humans, but I have used other libraries in the past.
		
</p>
<p>

			I also know R, SQL, C, bash, and few other languages.
			I&#x27;ve even managed to implement a few, such as a tiny FORTH-like and a working Brainfuck interpreter.
		
</p>
<p>

			My favorite type of statistical regression is the linear regression.
			I love its simplicity and effectiveness.
			However, that&#x27;s not the only method I know.
			I also can use A/B testing, the multi-armed bandit method, random forests, and various types of neural network algorithm.
		
</p>

 Highlights 
</h2>
<p>

			These are my favorite publicly-visible projects!
			Feel free to check them out.

<div class="card"> <h3>  How to cheat at Wordle  </h3> <p> 
			Wordle was purportedly created by Josh Wardle    as a fun word-guessing game.
			The rules are simple: You have six tries to guess a five-letter word.
			If a letter is guessed right, the letter gets colored green.
			If a letter is present in the word but it is not in that position, the letter gets colored yellow.
			Otherwise, the letter is colored gray.
			It&#x27;s a conceptually simple game, but it has spawned a large amount of discussion over how it can be optimized.

<div class="card"> <h3>  Snackflation Tracker  </h3> <p> 
To assess this market, I used a linear regression model.
I regressed the price value against the UNIX timestamp (in seconds).
I estimated beta-zero to be about -23.9563 and beta-one to be roughly 0.0 dollars/second.
My r-value is 0.9329, which implies high direct correlation.
The p-value is 0.0.
