				This web site is being remodeled to use a more modern CMS and SSG.
			</p>
			<p>
				The new CMS will allow a greater variety of content to be hosted on this site.
				For instance, it'll allow for <em>interactive demos</em>.
				These new features are intended to permit better demonstration of information.
				Expected site features include minigames, live or semi-live statistical predictions, simulations and emulations, neural networks that run in-browser, and more.
			</p>
			<p>
				The new SSG is therefore necessary to support this.
				It will be able to generate new types of HTML5 and ECMAScript, permitting both <em>static and dynamic widgets</em> for various roles and capabilities.
				The new SSG will also support modern accessibility endeavors.
				It'll permit people using screenreaders and other automated or semiautomated interfaces to interact more easily with my web site.
				This will be accomplished by using HTML5 semantic components, as well as by using the ARIA accessibility metadata tags.
				It'll even be able to handle multilingual text.
				This will vastly increase the accessibility and usability of the site.
			</p>
			<p>
				In summary, the web site is being remodeled to use a more modern CMS and SSG.
				The result of these new features will be to create a novel, more interesting experience for those who come to the site, while also increasing the amount of people who are capable of using this site.

</h2>
<p>
<span id = "
			I-am-proficient-" class = "hook"> </span>

			I am proficient in several programming languages.
			I am most skilled in modern 
<em> Python </em>
 implementations, especially 3.12.
			Atop data processing tools like Pandas, NumPy, and SciPy, I am also practiced in web scraping.
			I typically engage in web scraping using bs4 and Requests For Humans, but I have used other libraries in the past.

<span id = "
			I-also-know-R,-S" class = "hook"> </span>

			I also know R, SQL, C, bash, and few other languages.
			I&#x27;ve even managed to implement a few, such as a tiny FORTH-like and a working Brainfuck interpreter.
		
</p>
<p>
<span id = "
			My-favorite-type" class = "hook"> </span>

			My favorite type of statistical regression is the linear regression.
			I love its simplicity and effectiveness.
			However, that&#x27;s not the only method I know.
			I also can use A/B testing, the multi-armed bandit method, random forests, and various types of neural network algorithm.

<div class="card"> <h3>  How to cheat at Wordle  </h3> <p> Wordle is a simple game with a lot of underlying complexity.
			In this article, I discuss how I used information theory and probability theory to create a tool to play Wordle as efficiently as possible. </p> <a target="_blank" class="button funky-bg" href="how-to-cheat-at-wordle.html"> Read it! </a> </div>
<div class="card"> <h3>  About Snackflation  </h3> <p> 
			I built a fully automatic tool    to predict market behavior and price indices of popular snack foods.
			It works by using a simple linear regression model to predict the future value of snacks such as potato chips.
			I regressed prices against the date and found that the date tends to have a statistically-significant impact upon price.
			This reflects well-known notions of inflation as predicted by many empirical models, which state that (during short runs) a market tends to be in an inflationary state rather than a deflationary state and all goods&#x27; prices will therefore rise over time, often at rates which are somewhat consistent.
