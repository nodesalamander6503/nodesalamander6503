<h2>About me</h2>

<p>
I'm an 18-year-old junior at UC San Diego.
Math is a passion of mine, so I'm studying Probability and Statistics there!
I'm also getting a second degree in Economics, just because it seems neat and applicable.
Ideally, I'd really like to become something cool, like an econometrist or an actuary.
To achieve this, I am taking various actuarial exams.
</p>

<p>
I'm also learning other non-academic things.
For instance, I've been learning some neat math concepts:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Machine learning, including gradient descent</li>
    <li>Type theory</li>
    <li>Graph theory</li>
    <li>Set theory</li>
</ul>

<p>
I'm also learning some cool tech skills:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Programming in C</li>
    <li>Programming language development</li>
    <li>Low-level programming (especially ARM assembly)</li>
</ul>

<h2>About the site</h2>

<p>
The site is generated using an SSG (static site generator).
I write every page in a custom XML-based article format on my desktop computer.
The SSG converts each page into HTML in a special folder.
I can then simply use a <code>git commit</code> command to sync that folder to a GitHub repo.
That GitHub repo then shows my page as a <code>github.io</code> site.
</p>

<p>
I'm not John Moneybags, so rather than paying money for a cool advanced SSG, I just wrote my own.
It might not be as advanced as some SSGs, but it works just fine!
The SSG's core is written in Python.
It uses HTML templates to allow me to change the layout easily - that's how I am able to achieve homogeneity across the site.
All CSS is located in one central CSS document.
I don't use a preprocessor for my CSS yet, as it hasn't become necessary and I'm more proficient in raw CSS than in any preprocessors.
