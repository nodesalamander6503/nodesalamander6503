 Hi, I&#x27;m $NAME 
</h2>
<p>

			I&#x27;m a UC San Diego junior majoring in Probability &amp; Statistics, with a second major in Economics.
			I perform statistical analyses, study market trends, write software, and play games.
		
</p>
<h3>
 Skills and education 
</h3>
<p>

			I am proficient in several programming languages.
			I am most skilled in modern 
<em> Python </em>
 implementations, especially 3.12.
			Atop data processing tools like Pandas, NumPy, and SciPi, I am also practiced in web scraping.
			I typically engage in web scraping using bs4 and Requests For Humans, but I have used other libraries in the past.
		
</p>
<p>

			I also know R, SQL, C, bash, and few other languages.
			I&#x27;ve even managed to implement a few, such as a tiny FORTH-like and a working Brainfuck interpreter.
		
</p>
<p>

			My favorite type of statistical regression is the linear regression.
			I love its simplicity and effectiveness.
			However, that&#x27;s not the only method I know.
			I also can use A/B testing, the multi-armed bandit method, random forests, and various types of neural network algorithm.
